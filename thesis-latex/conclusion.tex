The idea of this work was to extend traditional answer set programming with a means to apply "side-effects", i.e. influence the outside world, from a program, while still preserving fully declarative semantics. To that end, we introduced the language extension \emph{Evolog}, which is a conservative extension to the ASP language under stood by the Alpha ASP solver. Evolog adds a formal representation of actions to ASP that is inspired by the Monad concept from funtional programming in that it treats the state of the world side-effects are applied on as input and output of an action function. In Evolog, this is captured in the notion of a \emph{Frame}, which describes the interactions of a program with the outside world by means of an interpretation function for action rules. In order to enable a practical implementation of this concept that can actually

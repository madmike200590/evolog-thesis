\section{Observations from writing Evolog code}

Considering the example application discussed in Section~\ref{sec:results-xml-graphcol}, this section aims to highlight potential areas for improvement of the language.

\paragraph{Unwrapping list terms}
As the examples in Section~\ref{sec:results-xml-graphcol} clearly show, there is a certain amount of boilerplate code involved whenever one has to "unpack" a list term obtained as an output term of a module literal.

TODO: turning into future work, what Evolog would need to get from prototype to product.
